Development Entropy shared utils is a collection of utility classes and scripts that were originally written for use in
one or more Deventropy projects and shifted here (with the goal of sharing them with other projects); or were written
here to be shared across projects.

See **[project website](http://www.deventropy.org/shared-utils/)** for more information.
